This is the monorepo for the truffle preserve framework which includes:

- @truffle/preserve which is the preserve framework
- @truffle/preserve-fs, which represents the thing you want to preserve, files
- @truffle/preserve-to-buckets, needed to preserve your thing to textile buckets
- @truffle/preserve-to-filecoin, needed to preserve your thing to filecoin
- @truffle/preserve-to-ipfs, needed to preserve your thing to IPFS

The [`truffle preserve` command](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/truffle-commands#preserve) comes preconfigured with the ability to preserve files to IPFS, Filecoin or Textile Buckets.

## Preserve to IPFS

To preserve your files to IPFS use the `--ipfs` flag.

```shell
$ truffle preserve ./path --ipfs [--environment <name>]
```

### Configuration

By default, the connection to IPFS is done with a local node presumed to be running at `http://localhost:5001`. This is the default for an `ipfs` daemon and also for `ganache filecoin`. It is possible to point to a different IPFS node by configuing a different URL in a `truffle-config.js` environment.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  /* ... rest of truffle-config */

  environments: {
    /* ... other environments */

    production: {
      ipfs: {
        address: "https://ipfs.infura.io:5001",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Preserve to Filecoin

To preserve your files to Filecoin use the `--filecoin` flag.

```shell
$ truffle preserve ./path --filecoin [--environment <name>]
```

### Configuration

By default, the connection to Filecoin is done with a local node presumed to be running at `http://localhost:7777/rpc/v0`. This is the default for a mainnet or localnet Lotus or Powergate node and also for `ganache filecoin`. It is possible to point to a different Filecoin node by configuing a different URL in a `truffle-config.js` environment. Besides the connection URL, you can also configure Filecoin storage deal options such as the duration or price.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  /* ... rest of truffle-config */

  environments: {
    /* ... other environments */

    development: {
      filecoin: {
        address: "http://localhost:1234/rpc/v0",
        token: "AUTH_TOKEN",
        storageDealOptions: {
          epochPrice: "2500",
          duration: 518400, // 180 days
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Preserve to Textile Buckets

To preserve your files to Textile Buckets use the `--buckets` flag.

```shell
$ truffle preserve ./path --buckets [--environment <name>]
```

### Configuration

Textile Buckets requires some configuration in order to work with `truffle preserve`. To get started, you need to install [Textile's `hub` tool](https://docs.textile.io/hub/), register and create authentication keys.

```shell
hub init
hub keys create
 - account
 - Require Signature Authentication (recommended): N
```

After generating these keys, they need to be added to an environment in your `truffle-config.js` file as well as the name of the bucket that you want to preserve your files to - it's possible to use an existing bucket for this, or if it doesn't exist yet it will be created in the process.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  /* ... rest of truffle-config */

  environments: {
    /* ... other environments */

    development: {
      buckets: {
        key: "MY_BUCKETS_KEY",
        secret: "MY_BUCKETS_SECRET",
        bucketName: "truffle-preserve-bucket",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Preserving with custom preserve recipes

While Truffle comes bundled with support for IPFS, Filecoin and Textile Buckets, additional workflows (or recipes) can be defined and used.

### Plugin installation / configuration

1. Install the plugin from NPM.

```shell
npm install --save-dev truffle-preserve-to-my-server
```

2. Add a `plugins` section to your Truffle config.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  /* ... rest of truffle-config */

  plugins: ["truffle-preserve-to-my-server"],
};
```

3. Add any required configuration options to your Truffle config if it's required by the plugin. Refer to the plugin's documentation for this.

### Plugin usage

After installation and configuration, the plugin's tag (e.g. `--my-server`) will show up in `truffle help preserve` and can be used with `truffle preserve`.

```shell
truffle preserve ./path --my-server
```
